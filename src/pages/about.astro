        Capturing the Magic of San Diego in Video Since 2019
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Heyl Productions is Erick and Sammie Heyl. We’re a husband and wife video production team that is proud to serve the community we’ve known all our lives.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Cinematic Wedding Videography is how we got our start. Our passion is capturing the emotion, beauty, and story of your wedding day so you can relive those moments for years to come. From intimate elopements to grand celebrations, we specialize in cinematic wedding films that are as unique as each couple we work with.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Erick and Sammie are both born and raised native San Diegans. Erick fell in love with videography several years ago, and quickly realized that he could use it to help support his growing family while also providing valuable services to the community he calls home.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Since then, the duo has served a rapidly growing number of San Diego couples and businesses, from beautiful weddings across Southern California to local shops like Hop Stop, Pretty Petals, Dirty Dough, and large corporate events like Yelp’s.

        How Heyl Productions Sets Ourselves Apart
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        As a small team, we know we have to go above and beyond to compete with large corporate video production companies with dozens of staff.
